							Our Story
						</h3>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                        As tailoring is one of the famous Burmese women traditional ways to earn money, we are very passionate to upgrade Burmese tailoring community by using technology. 
We realized that for ordinary women especially house wives, they don’t know how to find their market though they have talents in tailoring. What if there is a platform for them to broaden market size? Therefore, we start our webite. 
We want to fulfil the needs of society by applying our technology skills in innovative ways.

								Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
